title: Installing the Loggregator Firehose Plug-in for cf CLI
owner: Logging and Metrics
---

You can use the Loggregator Firehose Plug-in for the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI).

The Loggregator Firehose plug-in for the cf CLI allows <%= vars.app_runtime_first %> admins to access the output of the Loggregator Firehose. The output of the Firehose includes logs and metrics from apps deployed on <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> as well as metrics from <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> platform components. For more information about the Firehose, see the [Loggregator Architecture](./architecture.html#loggregator-architecture) section of the _Loggregator Architecture_ topic.

For more information about using plug-ins with the cf CLI, see [Using cf CLI plug-ins](../cf-cli/use-cli-plugins.html).

<p> You can deactivate the Firehose. In place of the Firehose, you can configure an aggregate log and metric drain for your foundation:

<%= vars.configure_system_logging_link %>
</p>
