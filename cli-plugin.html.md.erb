This topic describes how to install the Loggregator Firehose Plugin for the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI).


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

The Loggregator Firehose plugin for the cf CLI allows <%= vars.app_runtime_first %> admins to access the output of the Loggregator Firehose. The output of the Firehose includes logs and metrics from apps deployed on <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> as well as metrics from <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> platform components. For more information about the Firehose, see the [Loggregator Architecture](./architecture.html#loggregator-architecture) section of the _Loggregator Architecture_ topic.

For more information about using plugins with the cf CLI, see [Using cf CLI Plugins](../cf-cli/use-cli-plugins.html).

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> You can disable the Firehose. In place of the Firehose, you can configure an aggregate log and metric drain for your foundation. <%= vars.configure_system_logging_link %></p>
