title: Deploying a Nozzle to the Loggregator Firehose
owner: Logging and Metrics
---

<% $this_topic = 'nozzle-tutorial' %>

This topic describes deploying a nozzle app to the <%= vars.app_runtime_first %>
Loggregator Firehose. For more information about nozzles and the Loggregator Firehose, see
[Loggregator Architecture](./architecture.html). The <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Loggregator team created an example
nozzle app for use with this tutorial.

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

The procedure described below deploys an example nozzle to the Firehose of a <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>
installation deployed locally with BOSH Lite v2. For more information about BOSH Lite v2, see
[VirtualBox BOSH Lite v2](https://bosh.io/docs/bosh-lite/) in the BOSH documentation.

To reduce the load on custom nozzles that you develop, you can request Firehose subscriptions that emit only
metrics on an allow list. For examples, see `rlpreader` and `rlptypereader` in the
[Loggregator Tools](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/loggregator-tools) repository and
[V2 Subscriptions](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator-release/blob/develop/docs/v2-subscriptions.md) in the
Loggregator Relese repository in GitHub.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> You can disable the Firehose. In place of the Firehose, you can configure an
aggregate log and metric drain for your foundation. <%= vars.configure_system_logging_link %></p>

## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

Before you deploy a nozzle to the Loggregator Firehose, you must have:

* BOSH CLI installed locally. For more information, see [BOSH CLI](https://bosh.io/docs/bosh-cli.html) in the BOSH
documentation.

* Spiff installed locally and added to the load path of your shell. For more information, see the
[Spiff](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/spiff) repository on GitHub.

* BOSH Lite v2 deployed locally using VirtualBox. For more information about BOSH Lite v2, see
[VirtualBox BOSH Lite v2](https://bosh.io/docs/bosh-lite/) in the BOSH documentation.

* A working <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment, including Loggregator, deployed with your local BOSH Lite v2. This
deployment serves as the source of data. For more information, see
[Deploying Cloud Foundry with BOSH Lite v2](https://operator-workshop.cloudfoundry.org/labs/deploy-cf/) in the
Operating the Foundry documentation, or use the `provision_cf` script included in the BOSH Lite v2 release.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Deploying <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> can take several hours depending on your
internet bandwith, even when using the automated <code>provision_cf</code> script.</p>

## <a id='download-manifest'></a> Step 1: Download Cloud Foundry BOSH Manifest

To download the BOSH manifest:

<%= partial 'download_bosh_manifest' %>

## <a id='add-client'></a> Step 2: Add UAA Client

You must authorize the example nozzle as a UAA client for your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment. To do this, add
an entry for the example nozzle as a `client` for `uaa` under the `properties` key in your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>
deployment manifest YAML file. You must enter the example nozzle object in the correct location in the manifest, and
with the correct indentation.

To add the nozzle as a UAA client for your deployment:

1. Open the deployment manifest in a text editor.

1. Locate the left-aligned `properties` key.

1. Under the `properties` key, locate `uaa` at the next level of indentation.

1. Under the `uaa` key, locate the `clients` key at the next level of indentation.

1. Enter properties for the `example-nozzle` at the next level of indentation, exactly as shown below. The `...` in the
text below indicate other properties that might populate the manifest at each level in the hierarchy.

    ```
    properties:
      ...
      uaa:
      ...
        clients:
        ...
          example-nozzle:
            access-token-validity: 1209600
            authorized-grant-types: client_credentials
            override: true
            secret: example-nozzle
            authorities: oauth.login,doppler.firehose
    ```

1. Save the deployment manifest file.

## <a id='redeploy'></a> Step 3: Redeploy <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>

To redeploy <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> with BOSH, run:

```
bosh -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT deploy
```

Where `BOSH-ENVIRONMENT` is the alias that you set for your BOSH Director.

For example:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ bosh -e dev deploy
Acting as user 'admin' on deployment 'cf-warden' on 'Bosh Lite Director'
Getting deployment properties from director...

## <a id='clone-example-release'></a> Step 4: Clone Example Release

The <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Loggregator team created an example nozzle app for use with this tutorial.

To clone the example nozzle release:

1. Clone the main release repository from the example-nozzle-release repository on GitHub by running:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/example-nozzle-release.git
    ```

1. Navigate to the `example-nozzle-release` directory by running:

    ```
    cd example-nozzle-release
    ```

1. Update all of the included submodules by running:

    ```
	 git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```
	 For example:
    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ git submodule update --init --recursive
    Submodule 'src/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/example-nozzle' (<span>git@</span>github.com:cloudfoundry-incubator/example-nozzle.git) registered for path 'src/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/example-nozzle'
    Submodule 'src/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/uaago' (<span>git@</span>github.com:cloudfoundry-incubator/uaago.git) registered for path 'src/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/uaago'
    ...
    Cloning into 'src/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/example-nozzle'...
    ...
    </pre>

## <a id='prepare-nozzle-manifest'></a> Step 5: Prepare Nozzle Manifest

To prepare the nozzle deployment manifest:

1. In the `example-nozzle-release` directory, navigate to the `templates` directory by running:

    ```
    cd templates
    ```
    Within this directory, examine the two YAML files. `bosh-lite-stub.yml` contains the values used to populate the
    missing information in `template.yml`. By combining these two files, you can create a deployment manifest for the
    nozzle.

1. Create a `tmp` directory for the compiled manifest.

1. Use Spiff to compile a deployment manifest from the template and stub by running:

    ```
    spiff merge templates/template.yml templates/bosh-lite-stub.yml > tmp/manifest_bosh_lite.yml
    ```
    Save this manifest.

1. To identify the names of all deployments in the environment that you specify, run:

    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT deployments
    ```
    Where `BOSH-ENVIRONMENT` is the alias that you set for your BOSH Director.

1. To obtain your BOSH Director UUID, run:

    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT env --column=uuid
    ```
    Where `BOSH-ENVIRONMENT` is the alias that you set for your BOSH Director. For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh -e dev env --column=uuid
    </pre>

1. In the compiled nozzle deployment manifest, locate the `director_uuid` property. Replace `PLACEHOLDER-DIRECTOR-UUID`
with your BOSH Director UUID.

    ```
    compilation:
      cloud_properties:
        name: default
    network: example-nozzle-net
    reuse_compilation_vms: true
    workers: 1
    director_uuid: PLACEHOLDER-DIRECTOR-UUID
    ```

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If you do not want to see the complete deployment procedure, run
<code>scripts/make_manifest_spiff_bosh_lite</code> to automatically prepare the manifest.</p>

## <a id='create-nozzle-bosh-release'></a> Step 6: Create Nozzle BOSH Release

To create a nozzle BOSH release, run:

```
bosh -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT create-release --name RELEASE-NAME
```

Where:

* `BOSH-ENVIRONMENT` is the alias that you set for your BOSH Director.
* `RELEASE-NAME` is `example-nozzle` to match the UAA client that you created in the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>
deployment manifest.

For example:
<pre class='terminal'>
$ bosh -e dev create-release --name example-nozzle
Syncing blobs...
...
</pre>

## <a id='upload-nozzle-bosh-release'></a> Step 7: Upload Nozzle BOSH Release

Upload the nozzle BOSH release that you created in [Step 6: Create Nozzle BOSH Release](#create-nozzle-bosh-release) above.

To upload the BOSH release, run:

```
bosh -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT upload-release
```

Where `BOSH-ENVIRONMENT` is the alias that you set for your BOSH Director.

For example:
<pre class='terminal'>
$ bosh -e dev upload-release
Acting as user 'admin' on 'Bosh Lite Director'<br>

## <a id='deploy-nozzle'></a> Step 8: Deploy Nozzle

To deploy the nozzle, run:

```
bosh -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT deploy
```

Where `BOSH-ENVIRONMENT` is the alias that you set for your BOSH Director.

For example:
<pre class='terminal'>
$ bosh -e dev deploy
Acting as user 'admin' on deployment 'example-nozzle-lite' on 'Bosh Lite Director'

</pre>

## <a id='view-nozzle-output'></a> Step 9: View Nozzle Output

The example nozzle outputs all of the data originating coming from the Firehose to its log files. To view this data,
SSH into the `example-nozzle` VM and examine the logs.

To view nozzle output:

1. Access the nozzle VM at the IP address configured in the nozzle manifest template stub,
`./templates/bosh-lite-stub.yml`, by running:

    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT ssh
    ```
    Where `BOSH-ENVIRONMENT` is the alias that you set for your BOSH Director. For example:
    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ bosh -e dev ssh example-nozzle
    Welcome to Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.19.0-25-generic x86_64)

    Last login: Wed Sep 23 21:29:50 2015 from 192.0.2.1
    </pre>

1. Use the `cat` command to output the `stdout` log file.

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ cat /var/vcap/sys/log/example-nozzle/example-nozzle.stdout.log
