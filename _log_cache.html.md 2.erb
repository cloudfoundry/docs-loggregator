Log Cache allows you to view logs and metrics over a specified period of time. The Log Cache includes API endpoints and a CLI plugin to query and filter logs and metrics. To download the Log Cache CLI plugin, see [Cloud Foundry Plugins](https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org/). The Log Cache API endpoints are available by default. For more information about using the Log Cache API, see [Log Cache](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/log-cache#restful-api-via-gateway) on GitHub.
