<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes the Loggregator architecture and components. It also describes the <%= vars.product_name %> components that send BOSH-reported VM metrics to Loggregator.

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Loggregator gathers and streams logs and metrics from user apps in a <%= vars.first_product_name %> deployment as well as metrics from <%= vars.product_name %> components. For more information, see the [Loggregator repository on GitHub](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator).

Loggregator allows users to view logs and metrics through the Loggregator CLI plugins or through a third-party service. For more information about viewing logs and metrics in <%= vars.product_name %>, see [Overview of Logging and Metrics](./data-sources.html).

## <a id='components'></a> Loggregator Architecture and Components

The Loggregator architecture includes components for collecting, storing, and forwarding logs and metrics. The diagram below shows the architecture of Loggregator, including the <%= vars.product_name %> components with which it interacts.

The following are Loggregator components, as shown in the diagram above:

- **Forwarder Agent**: Forwarder Agents run on both <%= vars.product_name %> component VMs and host VMs. They receive logs and metrics from the apps and <%= vars.product_name %> components located on those VMs. They then forward the logs and metrics to the Loggregator Agent and Syslog Agent. 
- **Syslog Agent**: Syslog Agents run on both <%= vars.product_name %> component VMs and host VMs. They manage connections with and write to syslog drains. 
- **Loggregator Agent**: Loggregator Agents run on both <%= vars.product_name %> component VMs and host VMs. They receive logs and metrics from the Forwarder Agent and then forward the logs and metrics to Dopplers.
- **Doppler**: Dopplers receive logs and metrics from Loggregator Agents, store them in temporary buffers, and forward them to Traffic Controllers.
- **Traffic Controller**: Traffic Controllers poll Doppler servers for logs and metrics, then translate these messages from the Doppler servers as necessary for external and legacy APIs. The Loggregator Firehose is located on the Traffic Controller.
- **Reverse Log Proxy**: Reverse Log Proxies (RLPs) collect logs and metrics from Dopplers and forward them to the Log Cache. Operators can scale up the number of RLPs based on overall log volume. 
- **Firehose**: The Firehose is a WebSocket endpoint that streams all the event data from a <%= vars.product_name %> deployment. The data stream includes HTTP events, app logs, container metrics from apps, and metrics from <%= vars.product_name %> platform components.
- **Log Cache**: The Log Cache allows users to view logs and metrics from the Firehose over a specified period of time. The Log Cache includes API endpoints and a CLI plugin for users to query and filter logs and metrics. To download the Log Cache CLI plugin, see [Cloud Foundry Plugins](https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org/). The Log Cache API endpoints are available by default. For more information about using the Log Cache API, see [Log Cache](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/log-cache#restful-api-via-gateway) on GitHub.
- **Nozzles**: Nozzles are programs that consume data from the Loggregator Firehose. Nozzles can be configured to select, buffer, and transform data, and to forward it to other apps and services. For more information about creating and deploying nozzles, see [Deploying a Nozzle to the Loggregator Firehose](./nozzle-tutorial.html).

## <a id='bosh-metrics'></a>Related BOSH Components

This section describes the <%= vars.product_name %> components that forward BOSH-reported VM metrics to Loggregator. BOSH-reported VM metrics measure the health of BOSH-deployed VMs on which apps and <%= vars.product_name %> components are deployed. For more information about the components that forward BOSH-reported VM metrics to Loggregator, see [the BOSH Monitor repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh/tree/master/src/bosh-monitor) on GitHub.

The following are the <%= vars.product_name %> components that send BOSH-reported VM metrics to Loggregator:

* **BOSH Agent**: BOSH Agents are located on component VMs and Diego cell VMs. They collect metrics, such as cell capacity remaining, from the VM and forward them to the BOSH Health Monitor.

* **BOSH Health Monitor**: The BOSH Health Monitor receives metrics from the BOSH Agents. It then forwards the metrics to a third-party service or to the BOSH System Metrics Forwarder.

* **BOSH System Metrics Plugin**: This plugin reads health events, such as VM heartbeats and alerts from the BOSH Health Monitor, and streams them to the BOSH System Metrics Server.

* **BOSH System Metrics Server**: The BOSH System Metrics Server streams metrics and heartbeat events to the BOSH System Metrics Forwarder over gRPC. 

* **BOSH System Metrics Forwarder**: The BOSH System Metrics Forwarder is located on the Loggregator Traffic Controller. It forwards heartbeat events from the BOSH System Metrics Server as envelopes to Loggregator through a Loggregator Agent.
