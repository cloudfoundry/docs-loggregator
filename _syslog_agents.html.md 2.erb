Syslog Agents run on <%= vars.platform_name %> component VMs and host VMs to collect and forward logs to configured syslog drains. This includes syslog drains for individual apps as well as aggregate drains for all apps in your foundation. You can specify the destination for logs as part of the individual syslog drain or in the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.
