    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT deployments

    Where `BOSH-ENVIRONMENT` is the alias that you set for your BOSH Director. For example:

    <pre class="terminal">

1. Download and save the current BOSH deployment manifest by running:

    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT -d BOSH-DEPLOYMENT manifest > PATH-TO-MANIFEST.yml
    ```
    Where:
    * `BOSH-ENVIRONMENT` is your BOSH Director alias.
    * `BOSH-DEPLOYMENT` is the deployment name from the output of the previous step.
    * `PATH-TO-MANIFEST.yml` is a name that you choose for the saved manifest file. Use this manifest to locate
      information about your databases.

    For example:
    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ bosh -e dev -d cf-example manifest > cf.yml
    </pre>
