Log Cache allows viewing of logs and metrics over a specified period of time. The Log Cache includes API endpoints and a CLI plug-in to query and filter logs and metrics. To download the Log Cache CLI plug-in, see [Cloud Foundry Plug-ins](https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org/). The Log Cache API endpoints are available by default. For more information about using the Log Cache API, see [Log Cache](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/log-cache-release/tree/main/src#apis) on GitHub.
